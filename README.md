# Mya
Currently a game engine that I have been working on since 2017, but with a overall rewrite in 2020. Uses vulkan for graphics and will be cool.

# Warning!
The engine is still in alpha and is currently only worked on by me (Alex/bia5), so dev is slow and I normally customize the engine to my needs since no one else uses the engine. I cannot guarentee all things work on this engine at all times and if you have any feature requests then slide me a issue/email/push request and I will try to get back with you asap. <3

# Features
    -Lua Scripting (Run and handle the engine entirely within the lua instance)

# Current libs
as of 2020/Sep/20

    -SDL2
    -SOL2
    -Vulkan
