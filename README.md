# Mya
A 2D engine that I started working on in March 2017. It currently only uses the SDL2 renderer and only supports Windows. I started this project so I had nearly full control of my work enviroment and so I did not have to worry about any fee's that come with other engines like Unity. I update this when I feel like it or when I need to for my current game project. If you want to use the engine or are using it and you want a feature added or changed to accommodate you please open a issue. Also feel free to use this for anything as long as it meets the license requirements! :)
